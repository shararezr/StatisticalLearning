Statistical analyzing the life-expectancy dataset ("Life Expectancy (WHO)")
# Introduction

Our motivation in choosing this data-set for further analysis was due to
problems that we hope we can answer:

1.  Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially
    really affect the Life expectancy?

2.  What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life
    expectancy?

3.  Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(\<65) increase
    its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
    How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?

4.  Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with
    eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.

5.  What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?

6.  Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with
    drinking alcohol?

7.  Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?

8.  What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?

9.  Do the sample gives enough evidence to say that Developed countries
    have more average life expectancy than Developing countries?

10. Do the countries that spend a higher proportion of their resources
    on human development have a higher life expectancy?

11. What is the most frequent range of life expectancy?
